						<h2 class="post-title">5 Things I Learnt from 100 Days of Not Smoking</h2>
						<p><em>Reposted from the old blog, written on 8th January 2017. Happy to report that as of 25th November 2018, I’ve succeeded in not smoking for more than two years.</em></p>

<p>Today marks 100 days since I quit smoking, and while the basic tenet of not smoking is “Don’t fucking smoke!”, I think there were some surprises and/or revelations that I’d like to note down in case I get complacent down the line.</p>

<h1 id="1-you-dont-have-control">1. You don’t have control</h1>

<p>In ten years of being a smoker, I must have told myself hundreds of times that I could cut down to just one or two cigarettes a day, that I could quit ‘whenever I want’ or even that once I quit, I could then maybe steal a few puffs from other people’s cigarettes and not really smoke again.</p>

<p>Nope, none of that worked. I’d always fall back into the habit. However much I love smoking (and that’s a <em>lot</em>), the Golden Rule is the Golden Rule for a reason:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not another puff. No matter what.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have a screenshot of this on my phone that I used to look at for the first month or so whenever my brain tried to convince me that maybe I could have one puff without worrying about it.</p>

<p>I don’t need to look at it anymore, but I still repeat it to myself whenever I see a cigarette and think, “That looks nice.”</p>

<h1 id="2-once-an-addict-always-an-addict">2. Once an addict, always an addict</h1>

<p>This is a corollary to the first one. My addict’s mantra is that since I don’t know where to stop, the only solution is not to begin.</p>

<p>While the cravings have now mostly gone away, and my brain chemistry does not factor nicotine into everything it does, I have to be aware of the fact that I’m <em>always</em> five minutes away from my next cigarette. Each and every cigarette I’m confronted with is tempting to a greater or lesser degree.</p>

<p>There were times in the past when I fooled myself into thinking that I was <em>no longer</em> an addict, but that is and will probably always be bullshit.</p>

<h1 id="3-quitting-is-not-a-golden-ticket-to-health">3. Quitting is not a golden ticket to health</h1>

<p>This one’s fairly obvious to people who don’t smoke, but when I was smoking, I convinced myself that if only I could quit smoking, I’d start doing all the healthy things and, I dunno, run or something like that. That did not happen.</p>

<p>Also, there was this constriction I used to feel in my chest when I woke up in the morning that I’d always assumed was because of my smoking. Turns out I’d just been sleeping wrong for fucking <em>years</em>.</p>

<h1 id="4-not-being-a-smoker-is-nice">4. Not being a smoker is nice</h1>

<p>While I have not miraculously turned into a model of health since I quit smoking, it is, generally, <em>nice</em> to not be a smoker. I can taste better, there isn’t the physical drag of diminished lung capacity, and my mind isn’t constantly wandering to when I’ll next get a chance to smoke.</p>

<p>The worst thing about being a smoker, for me, was being under the invisible hold of something that literally turned my brain against me - a passenger that would <em>make me want to</em> do something to myself that was so bad for me. It’s nice not to feel like that every single day.</p>

<h1 id="5-the-feelings-all-the-feelings">5. The feelings, all the feelings</h1>

<p>Theoretically, I knew that smoking numbs your reactions to things that happen to you. Since I quit, I’ve just <em>felt</em> more. (And not just as a consequence of withdrawal - this is afterwards.) This is not, to be sure, a <em>good</em> or <em>bad</em> thing. It’s mostly like the return of taste - there are a lot more flavours to emotions that I can now experience.</p>

<p>It was difficult for a while, but you get used to it, your brain gets more able to manage it, and then it starts feeling normal. You should know - I’m sure most people reading this aren’t gibbering wrecks just because they don’t smoke. It’s fine.</p>

<h1 id="5b-coffee">5b. Coffee</h1>

<p>This isn’t a full point by itself, but I’ve become a <em>lot</em> more sensitive to the physical effects of coffee since I stopped smoking, and that sucks, because now I can only drink it a couple of times a week.</p>

<p>And I <em>like</em> coffee, dammit.</p>
